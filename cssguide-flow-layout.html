          <h3>Block and inline layout in normal flow</h3>
          <p>
            In this guide, we will explore the basics of how Block and Inline
            elements behave when they are part of the normal flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Normal Flow is defined in the CSS 2.1 specification, which explains
            that any boxes in normal flow will be part of a formatting context.
            They can be either block or inline, but not both at once. We
            describe block-level boxes as participating in a block formatting
            context, and inline-level boxes as participating in an inline
            formatting context.
          </p>
          <p>
            The behavior of elements which have a block or inline formatting
            context is also defined in this specification. For elements with a
            block formatting context, the spec says:
          </p>
          <p>
            <q
              >"In a block formatting context, boxes are laid out one after the
              other, vertically, beginning at the top of a containing block. The
              vertical distance between two sibling boxes is determined by the
              'margin' properties. Vertical margins between adjacent block-level
              boxes in a block formatting context collapse.<br />
              In a block formatting context, each box's left outer edge touches
              the left edge of the containing block (for right-to-left
              formatting, right edges touch)." - 9.4.1
            </q>
          </p>
          <p>For elements with an inline formatting context:</p>
          <p>
            <q
              >"In an inline formatting context, boxes are laid out
              horizontally, one after the other, beginning at the top of a
              containing block. Horizontal margins, borders, and padding are
              respected between these boxes. The boxes may be aligned vertically
              in different ways: their bottoms or tops may be aligned, or the
              baselines of text within them may be aligned. The rectangular area
              that contains the boxes that form a line is called a line box." -
              9.4.2
            </q>
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that the CSS 2.1 specification describes documents as being in
            a horizontal, top to bottom writing mode. For example, by describing
            vertical distance between block boxes. The behavior on block and
            inline elements is the same when working in a vertical writing mode,
            and we will explore this in a future guide on Flow Layout and
            Writing Modes.
          </p>
          <h3>Elements participating in a block formatting context</h3>
          <p>
            Block elements in a horizontal writing mode such as English, layout
            vertically, one below the other.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/block-inline-layout-normal-flow-1.png" />
          <p>In a vertical writing mode then would lay out horizontally.</p>
          <img src="./images/block-inline-layout-normal-flow-2.png" />
          <p>
            In this guide, we will be working in English and therefore a
            horizontal writing mode. However, everything described should work
            in the same way if your document is in a vertical writing mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            As defined in the specification, the margins between two block boxes
            are what creates separation between the elements. We see this with a
            very simple layout of two paragraphs, to which I have added a
            border. The default browser stylesheet adds spacing between the
            paragraphs by way of adding a margin to the top and bottom.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/block-inline-layout-normal-flow-3.png" />
          <p>
            If we set margins on the paragraph element to 0 then the borders
            will touch.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/block-inline-layout-normal-flow-4.png" />
          <p>
            By default block elements will consume all of the space in the
            inline direction, so our paragraphs spread out and get as big as
            they can inside their containing block. If we give them a width,
            they will continue to lay out one below the other - even if there
            would be space for them to be side by side. Each will start against
            the start edge of the containing block, so the place at which
            sentences would begin in that writing mode.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/block-inline-layout-normal-flow-5.png" />
          <h4>Margin collapsing</h4>
          <p>
            The spec explains that margins between block elements collapse. This
            means that if you have an element with a top margin immediately
            after an element with a bottom margin, rather than the total space
            being the sum of these two margins, the margin collapses, and so
            will essentially become as large as the larger of the two margins.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the example below, the paragraphs have a top margin of 20px and a
            bottom margin of 40px. The size of the margin between the paragraphs
            is 40px as the smaller top margin on the second paragraph has
            collapsed with the larger bottom margin of the first.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/block-inline-layout-normal-flow-6.png" />
          <p>
            You can read more about margin collapsing in our article Mastering
            Margin Collapsing.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/block-inline-layout-normal-flow-7.png" />
          <h3>Elements participating in an inline formatting context</h3>
          <p>
            Inline elements display one after the other in the direction that
            sentences run in that particular writing mode. While we don't tend
            to think of inline elements as having a box, as with everything in
            CSS they do. These inline boxes are arranged one after the other. If
            there is not enough space in the containing block for all of the
            boxes a box can break onto a new line. The lines created are known
            as line boxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the following example, we have three inline boxes created by a
            paragraph with a "strong" element inside it.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/block-inline-layout-normal-flow-8.png" />
          <p>
            The boxes around the words before the "strong" element and after the
            "strong" element are referred to as anonymous boxes, boxes
            introduced to ensure that everything is wrapped in a box, but ones
            that we cannot target directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The line box size in the block direction (so the height when working
            in English) is defined by the tallest box inside it. In the next
            example, I have made the "strong" element 300%; that content now
            defines the height of the line box on that line.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/block-inline-layout-normal-flow-9.png" />
          <p>
            Find out more about how Block and Inline Boxes behave in our Guide
            to the Visual Formatting Model.
          </p>
          <h3>The display property and flow layout</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to the rules existing in CSS2.1, new levels of CSS
            further describe the behavior of block and inline boxes. The display
            property defines how a box and any boxes inside it behave. In the
            CSS Display Model Level 3, we can learn more about how the display
            property changes the behavior of boxes and the boxes they generate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The display type of an element defines the outer display type; this
            dictates how the box displays alongside other elements in the same
            formatting context. It also defines the inner display type, which
            dictates how boxes inside this element behave. We can see this very
            clearly when considering a flex layout. In the example below I have
            a "div", which I have given display: flex. The flex container
            behaves like a block element: it displays on a new line and takes up
            all of the space it can in the inline direction. This is the outer
            display type of block.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flex items however are participating in a flex formatting
            context, because their parent is the element with display: flex,
            which has an inner display type of flex, establishing the flex
            formatting context for the direct children.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/block-inline-layout-normal-flow-10.png" />
          <p>
            Therefore you can think of every box in CSS working in this way. The
            box itself has an outer display type, so it knows how to behave
            alongside other boxes. It then has an inner display type which
            changes the way its children behave. Those children then have an
            outer and inner display type too. The flex items in the previous
            example become flex level boxes, so their outer display type is
            dictated by way of them being part of the flex formatting context.
            They have an inner display type of flow however, meaning that their
            children participate in normal flow. Items nested inside our flex
            item lay themselves out as block and inline elements unless
            something changes their display type.
          </p>
          <p>
            This concept of the outer and inner display type is important as
            this tells us that a container using a layout method such as Flexbox
            (display: flex) and Grid Layout (display: grid) is still
            participating in block and inline layout, due to the outer display
            type of those methods being block.
          </p>
          <h4>Changing the Formatting Context an element participates in</h4>
          <p>
            Browsers display items as part of a block or inline formatting
            context in terms of what normally makes sense for that element. For
            example, a "strong" element is used to highlight a word and displays
            bold in browsers. It would not generally make sense for that
            "strong" element to be displayed as a block level element, breaking
            onto a new line. If you did want all "strong" elements to display as
            block elements, you could do so by setting display: block on
            "strong". This means that you can always use most of the semantic
            HTML elements to markup your content, and then change the way it
            displays using CSS.
          </p>

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            In this guide, we have looked at how elements display in normal
            flow, as block and inline elements. Due to the default behavior of
            these elements, an HTML document with no CSS styling at all, will
            display in a readable way. By understanding how normal flow works
            you will find layout easier, as you understand the starting point
            for making changes to how elements are displayed.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>In Flow and Out of Flow</h3>
          <p>
            In the previous guide I explained block and inline layout in normal
            flow. All elements that are in flow, will be laid out using this
            method.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the following example I have a heading, paragraph, a list and a
            final paragraph which contains a strong element. The heading and
            paragraphs are block level, the strong element inline. The list is
            displayed using flexbox to arrange the items into a row, however it
            too is participating in block and inline layout - the container has
            an outside display type of block.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flowin-flowout-1.PNG" />
          <p>
            All of the elements can be said to be in flow. Appearing on the page
            in the order that they are in the source.
          </p>
          <h3>Taking an item out of flow</h3>
          <p>All elements are in-flow apart from:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>floated items</li>
            <li>
              items with position: absolute (including position: fixed which
              acts in the same way)
            </li>
            <li>the root element (html)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Out of flow items create a new Block Formatting Context (BFC) and
            therefore everything inside them can be seen as a mini layout,
            separate from the rest of the page. The root element therefore is
            out of flow, as the container for everything in our document, and
            establishes the Block Formatting Context for the document.
          </p>
          <h3>Floated Items</h3>
          <p>
            In this example I have a div, and then two paragraphs. I've added a
            background color to the paragraphs, and then floated the div left.
            The div is now out of flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a float it is first laid out according to where it would be in
            normal flow, then taken out of flow and moved to the left as far as
            possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can see the background color of the following paragraph running
            underneath, it is only the line boxes of that paragraph that have
            been shortened to cause the effect of wrapping content around the
            float. The box of our paragraph is still displaying according to the
            rules of normal flow. This is why, to make space around a floated
            item, you must add a margin to the item, in order to push the line
            boxes away from it. You cannot apply anything to the following
            in-flow content to achieve that.
          </p>
          <h4>Absolute Positioning</h4>
          <p>
            Giving an item position: absolute or position: fixed removes it from
            flow, and any space that it would have taken up is removed. In the
            next example I have three paragraph elements, the second element has
            position absolute, with offset values of top: 30px and right: 30px.
            It has been removed from document flow.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flowin-flowout-3.PNG" />
          <p>
            Using position: fixed also removes the item from flow, however the
            offsets are based on the viewport rather than the containing block.
          </p>
          <p>
            When taking an item out of flow with positioning, you will need to
            manage the possibility of content overlapping. Out of flow
            essentially means that the other elements on your page no longer
            know that element exists so will not respond to it.
          </p>
          <h4>Relative Positioning and Flow</h4>
          <p>
            If you give an item relative positioning with position: relative it
            remains in flow, however you are then able to use the offset values
            to push it around. The space that it would have been placed in
            normal flow is reserved however, as you can see in the example
            below.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flowin-flowout-4.PNG" />
          <p>
            When you do anything to remove, or shift an item from where it would
            be placed in normal flow, you can expect to need to do some managing
            of the content and the content around it to prevent overlaps.
            Whether that involves clearing floats, or ensuring that an element
            with position: absolute does not sit on top of some other content.
            For this reason methods which remove elements from being in-flow
            should be used with understanding of the effect that they have.
          </p>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            In this guide we have covered the ways to take an element out of
            flow in order to achieve some very specific types of positioning. In
            the next guide we will look at a related issue, that of creating a
            Block Formatting Context, in Formatting Contexts Explained.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Introduction to formatting contexts</h3>
          <p>
            This article introduces the concept of formatting contexts, of which
            there are several types, including block formatting contexts, inline
            formatting contexts, and flex formatting contexts. The basics of how
            they behave and how you can make use of these behaviors are also
            introduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything on a page is part of a formatting context, or an area
            which has been defined to lay out content in a particular way. A
            block formatting context (BFC) will lay child elements out according
            to block layout rules, a flex formatting context will lay its
            children out as flex items, etc. Each formatting context has
            specific rules about how layout behaves when in that context.
          </p>
          <h3>Block formatting contexts</h3>
          <p>
            The outermost element in a document that uses block layout rules
            establishes the first, or initial block formatting context. This
            means that every element inside the "html" element's block is laid
            out according to normal flow following the rules for block and
            inline layout. Elements participating in a BFC use the rules
            outlined by the CSS Box Model, which defines how an element's
            margins, borders, and padding interact with other blocks in the same
            context.
          </p>
          <h4>Creating a new block formatting context</h4>
          <p>
            The "html" element is not the only element capable of creating a
            block formatting context. Any block-level element can be made to
            create a BFC by the application of certain CSS properties.
          </p>
          <p>A new BFC is created in the following situations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>elements made to float using float</li>
            <li>absolutely positioned elements</li>
            <li>elements with display: inline-block</li>
            <li>
              table cells or elements with display: table-cell, including
              anonymous table cells created when using the display: table-*
              properties
            </li>
            <li>table captions or elements with display: table-caption</li>
            <li>
              block elements where overflow has a value other than visible
            </li>
            <li>
              elements with display: flow-root or display: flow-root list-item
            </li>
            <li>elements with contain: layout, content, or strict</li>
            <li>flex items</li>
            <li>grid items</li>
            <li>multicol containers</li>
            <li>elements with column-span set to all</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is useful because a new BFC will behave much like the outermost
            document in that it becomes a mini-layout inside the main layout. A
            BFC contains everything inside it, float and clear only apply to
            items inside the same formatting context, and margins only collapse
            between elements in the same formatting context.
          </p>
          <h4>BFC creation examples</h4>
          <p>
            Let's have a look at a couple of these in order to see the effect
            creating a new BFC.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the example below, we have a floated element inside a "div" with
            a border applied. The content of that "div" has floated alongside
            the floated element. As the content of the float is taller than the
            content alongside it, the border of the "div" now runs through the
            float. As explained in the guide to in-flow and out of flow
            elements, the float has been taken out of flow so the background and
            border of the div only contain the content and not the float. s
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flowin-flowout-5.PNG" />
          <p>
            Creating a new BFC would contain the float. A typical way to do this
            in the past has been to set overflow: auto or set other values than
            the initial value of overflow: visible.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flowin-flowout-6.PNG" />
          <p>
            Setting overflow: auto created a new BFC containing the float. Our
            "div" now becomes a mini-layout inside our layout. Any child element
            will be contained inside it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem with using overflow to create a new BFC is that the
            overflow property is meant for telling the browser how you wish to
            deal with overflowing content. There are some occasions in which you
            will find you get unwanted scrollbars or clipped shadows when you
            use this property purely to create a BFC. In addition, it is
            potentially not very readable for a future developer, as it may not
            be obvious why you used overflow for this purpose. If you do this,
            it would be a good idea to comment the code to explain.
          </p>
          <h4>Explicitly creating a BFC using display: flow-root</h4>
          <p>
            Using display: flow-root (or display: flow-root list-item) on the
            containing block will create a new BFC without any other potentially
            problematic side-effects.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flowin-flowout-7.PNG" />
          <p>
            With display: flow-root on the "div", everything inside that
            container participates in the block formatting context of that
            container, and floats will not poke out of the bottom of the
            element.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name of the flow-root keyword refers to the fact that you're
            creating something that serves, in essence, like a new root element
            (like "html" does), given how the new context is created and its
            flow layout functions.
          </p>
          <h3>Inline formatting contexts</h3>
          <p>
            Inline formatting contexts exist inside other formatting contexts
            and can be thought of as the context of a paragraph. The paragraph
            creates an inline formatting context inside which such things as
            "strong", "a", or "span" elements are used on text.
          </p>
          <p>
            The box model does not fully apply to items participating in an
            inline formatting context. In a horizontal writing mode line,
            horizontal padding, borders and margin will be applied to the
            element and push the text away left and right. However, margins
            above and below the element will not be applied. Vertical padding
            and borders will be applied but may overlap content above and below
            as, in the inline formatting context, the line boxes will not be
            pushed apart by padding and borders.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flowin-flowout-8.PNG" />
          <h3>Other formatting contexts</h3>
          <p>
            This guide covers flow layout and is therefore not referring to
            other possible formatting contexts. As such, it is useful to
            understand that creating any kind of formatting context will change
            the way elements inside that formatting context behave. This
            behavior is always described in the specification and also here on
            MDN.
          </p>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            In this guide, we have looked in more detail at the block and Inline
            formatting contexts and the important subject of creating a block
            formatting context (BFC). In the next guide, we will find out how
            normal flow interacts with different writing modes.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Flow Layout and Writing Modes</h3>
          <p>
            The CSS 2.1 specification, which details how normal flow behaves,
            assumes a horizontal writing mode. Layout properties should work in
            the same way in vertical writing modes. In this guide, we look at
            how flow layout behaves when used with different document writing
            modes.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not a comprehensive guide to the use of writing modes in
            CSS, the aim here is to document the areas where flow layout
            interacts with writing modes in possibly unanticipated ways. The
            external resources and see also sections of this document link to
            more writing modes resources.
          </p>
          <h3>The Writing Modes Specification</h3>
          <p>
            The CSS Writing Modes Level 3 Specification defines the impact a
            change the document writing mode has on flow layout. In the writing
            modes introduction, the specification says,
          </p>
          <p>
            <q
              >"A writing mode in CSS is determined by the writing-mode,
              direction, and text-orientation properties. It is defined
              primarily in terms of its inline base direction and block flow
              direction."
            </q>
          </p>
          <p>
            The specification defines the inline base direction as the direction
            in which content is ordered on a line. This defines the start and
            end of the inline direction. The start is where sentences start and
            the end is where a line of text ends before it would begin to wrap
            onto a new line.
          </p>
          <p>
            The block flow direction is the direction in which boxes, for
            example paragraphs, stack in that writing mode. The CSS writing-mode
            property controls the block flow direction. If you want to change
            your page, or part of your page, to vertical-lr then you can set
            writing-mode: vertical-lr on the element and this will change the
            direction of the blocks and therefore the inline direction as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            While certain languages will use a particular writing mode or text
            direction, we can also use these properties for creative effect,
            such as running a heading vertically. s
          </p>
          <img src="./images/writing-mode-flow-layout-1.PNG" />
          <h3>The writing-mode property and block flow</h3>
          <p>
            The writing-mode property accepts the values horizontal-tb,
            vertical-rl and vertical-lr. These values control the direction that
            blocks flow on the page. The initial value is horizontal-tb, which
            is a top to bottom block flow direction with a horizontal inline
            direction. Left to right languages, such as English, and Right to
            left languages. such as Arabic, are all horizontal-tb.
          </p>
          <p>The following example shows blocks using horizontal-tb.</p>
          <img src="./images/writing-mode-flow-layout-2.PNG" />
          <p>
            The value vertical-rl gives you a right-to-left block flow direction
            with a vertical inline direction, as shown in the next example.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/writing-mode-flow-layout-3.PNG" />
          <p>
            The final example demonstrates the third possible value for
            writing-mode — vertical-lr. This gives you a left-to-right block
            flow direction and a vertical inline direction.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/writing-mode-flow-layout-4.PNG" />
          <h3>Boxes with a different writing mode to their parent</h3>
          <p>
            When a nested box is assigned a different writing mode to its
            parent, then an inline level box will display as if it has display:
            inline-block.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/writing-mode-flow-layout-5.PNG" />
          <p>
            A block-level box will establish a new block formatting context,
            meaning that if its inner display type would be flow, it will get a
            computed display type of flow-root. This is shown in the next
            example where the box which displays as horizontal-tb contains a
            float which is contained due to its parent establishing a new BFC.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/writing-mode-flow-layout-6.PNG" />
          <img src="./images/writing-mode-flow-layout-7.PNG" />
          <h3>Replaced elements</h3>
          <p>
            Replaced elements such as images will not change their orientation
            based on the writing-mode property. However, replaced elements such
            as form controls which include text, should match the writing mode
            in use.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/writing-mode-flow-layout-8.PNG" />
          <img src="./images/writing-mode-flow-layout-9.PNG" />
          <h3>Logical Properties and Values</h3>
          <p>
            Once you are working in writing modes other than horizontal-tb many
            of the properties and values that are mapped to the physical
            dimensions of the screen seem strange. For example, if you give a
            box a width of 100px, in horizontal-tb that would control the size
            in the inline direction. In vertical-lr it controls the size in the
            block direction because it does not rotate with the text.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/writing-mode-flow-layout-10.PNG" />
          <p>
            Therefore, we have new properties of block-size and inline-size. If
            we give our block an inline-size of 100px, it doesn't matter whether
            we are in a horizontal or a vertical writing mode, inline-size will
            always mean the size in the inline direction.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/writing-mode-flow-layout-11.PNG" />
          <p>
            The CSS Logical Properties and Values specification includes logical
            versions of the properties that control margins, padding and borders
            as well as other mappings for things that we have typically used
            physical directions to specify.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/writing-mode-flow-layout-12.PNG" />
          <p>
            The CSS Logical Properties and Values specification includes logical

          </p>

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            In most cases, flow layout works as you would expect it to when
            changing the writing mode of the document or parts of the document.
            This can be used to properly typeset vertical languages or for
            creative reasons. CSS is making this easier by way of introducing
            logical properties and values so that when working in a vertical
            writing mode sizing can be based on element's inline and block size.
            This will be useful when creating components which can work in
            different writing-modes.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Flow Layout and Overflow</h3>
          <p>
            When there is more content than can fit into a container, an
            overflow situation occurs. Understanding how overflow behaves is
            important in dealing with any element with a constrained size in
            CSS. This guide explains how overflow works when working with normal
            flow.
          </p>
          <h3>What is overflow?</h3>
          <p>
            Giving an element a fixed height and width, then adding significant
            content to the box, creates a basic overflow example:
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flow-overflow-1.PNG" />
          <p>
            The content goes into the box. Once it fills the box, it continues
            to overflow in a visible way, displaying content outside the box,
            potentially displaying under subsequent content. The property that
            controls how overflow behaves is the overflow property which has an
            initial value of visible. This is why we can see the overflow
            content.
          </p>
          <h3>Controlling overflow</h3>
          <p>
            There are other values that control how overflow content behaves. To
            hide overflowing content use a value of hidden. This may cause some
            of your content to not be visible.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flow-overflow-2.PNG" />
          <p>
            Using a value of scroll contains the content in its box and add
            scrollbars to enable viewing it. Scrollbars will be added even if
            the content fits in the box.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flow-overflow-3.PNG" />
          <p>
            Using a value of auto will display the content with no scrollbars if
            the content fits inside the box. If it doesn't fit then scrollbars
            will be added. Comparing the next example with the example for
            overflow: scroll you should see overflow scroll has horizontal and
            vertical scrollbars when it only needs vertical scrolling. The auto
            example below only adds the scrollbar in the direct we need to
            scroll.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flow-overflow-4.PNG" />
          <p>
            As we have already learned, using any of these values, other than
            the default of visible, will create a new Block Formatting Context.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: In the Working Draft of Overflow Level 3, there is an
            additional value overflow: clip. This will act like overflow: hidden
            however it does not allow for programmatic scrolling, the box
            becomes non-scrollable. In addition it does not create a Block
            Formatting Context.
          </p>
          <p>
            The overflow property is in reality a shorthand for the overflow-x
            and overflow-y properties. If you specify only one value for
            overflow, this value is used for both axes. However, you can specify
            both values in which case the first is used for overflow-x and
            therefore the horizontal direction, and the second for overflow-y
            and the vertical direction. In the below example, I have only
            specified overflow-y: scroll so we do not get the unwanted
            horizontal scrollbar.

          <h3>Flow Relative Properties</h3>
          <p>
            In the guide to Writing Modes and Flow Layout, we looked at the
            newer properties of block-size and inline-size which make more sense
            when working with different writing modes than tying our layout to
            the physical dimensions of the screen. The Level 3 Overflow Module
            also includes flow relative properties for overflow - overflow-block
            and overflow-inline. These correspond to overflow-x and overflow-y
            but the mapping depends on the writing mode of the document.
          </p>
          <p>
            These properties currently do not have implementations in browsers,
            so you will need to use the physical properties at the present time
            and adjust for your writing mode.
          </p>
          <h3>Indicating Overflow</h3>
          <p>
            In the Level 3 Overflow specification we have some properties which
            can help improve the way content looks in an overflow situation.
          </p>
          <h4>Inline-Axis Overflow</h4>
          <p>
            The text-overflow property deals with text overflowing in the inline
            direction. It takes one of two values clip, in which case content is
            clipped when it overflows, this is the initial value and therefore
            the default behavior. We also have ellipsis which renders an
            ellipsis, which may be replaced with a better character for the
            language or writing mode in use.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flow-overflow-6.PNG" />
          <h4>Block-Axis Overflow</h4>
          <p>
            There is also a proposal for a block-overflow property, although at
            the time of writing the name is still up for discussion. This
            proposal would enable the adding of an ellipsis when text overflows
            in the block dimension.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is useful in the situation where you have a listing of
            articles, for example, and you display the listings in fixed height
            boxes which only take a limited amount of text. It may not be
            obvious to the reader that there is more content to click through to
            when clicking the box or the title. An ellipsis indicates clearly
            the fact there is more content. The specification would allow a
            string of content or a regular ellipsis to be inserted.
          </p>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            Whether you are in continuous media on the web or in a Paged Media
            format such as print or EPUB, understanding how content overflows is
            useful when dealing with any layout method. By understanding how
            overflow works in normal flow, you should find it easier to
            understand the implications of overflow content in layout methods
            such as grid and flexbox.
