            <h4>Basic concepts of flexbox</h4>
            <p class="concept_definition">
              The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was
              designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that
              could offer space distribution between items in an interface and
              powerful alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of
              the main features of flexbox, which we will be exploring in more
              detail in the rest of these guides.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are
              describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one
              dimension at a time — either as a row or as a column. This can be
              contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout,
              which controls columns and rows together.

          <h3>The two axes of flexbox</h3>
          <p>
            When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes —
            the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the
            flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to
            it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it
            is worth understanding how they work from the outset.
          </p>
          <h4>The main axis</h4>
          <p>
            On the web, the default origin is the top-left corner of a given
            context (with positive y-coordinate values being below the origin).
            Note that this is unlike most mathematical models, where the origin
            is at the bottom-left corner, with positive y-coordinate values
            being above the origin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible
            values:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>row</li>
            <li>row-reverse</li>
            <li>column</li>
            <li>column-reverse</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Should you choose row or row-reverse, your main axis will run along
            the row in the inline direction.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-1.png" />
          <p>
            Choose column or column-reverse and your main axis will run from the
            top of the page to the bottom — in the block direction.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-2.png" />
          <h4>The cross axis</h4>
          <p>
            The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if
            your flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse the
            cross axis runs down the columns.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-3.png" />
          <p>
            If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis
            runs along the rows.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-4.png" />
          <h4>Start and end lines</h4>

          <p>
            Another vital area of understanding is how flexbox makes no
            assumption about the writing mode of the document. In the past, CSS
            was heavily weighted towards horizontal and left-to-right writing
            modes. Modern layout methods encompass the range of writing modes
            and so we no longer assume that a line of text will start at the top
            left of a document and run towards the right-hand side, with new
            lines appearing one under the other.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can read more about the relationship between flexbox and the
            Writing Modes specification in a later article; however, the
            following description should help explain why we do not talk about
            left and right and top and bottom when we describe the direction
            that our flex items flow in.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the flex-direction is row and I am working in English, then the
            start edge of the main axis will be on the left, the end edge on the
            right.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-5.png" />
          <p>
            If I were to work in Arabic, then the start edge of my main axis
            would be on the right and the end edge on the left.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-6.png" />
          <p>
            In both cases the start edge of the cross axis is at the top of the
            flex container and the end edge at the bottom, as both languages
            have a horizontal writing mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a while, thinking about start and end rather than left and
            right becomes natural, and will be useful to you when dealing with
            other layout methods such as CSS Grid Layout which follow the same
            patterns.

          <h3>The flex container</h3>
          <p>
            An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex
            container. To create a flex container, we set the value of the
            area's container's display property to flex or inline-flex. As soon
            as we do this the direct children of that container become flex
            items. As with all properties in CSS, some initial values are
            defined, so when creating a flex container all of the contained flex
            items will behave in the following way.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Items display in a row (the flex-direction property's default is
              row).
            </li>
            <li>The items start from the start edge of the main axis.</li>
            <li>
              The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink.
            </li>
            <li>The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis.</li>
            <li>The flex-basis property is set to auto.</li>
            <li>The flex-wrap property is set to nowrap.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The result of this is that your items will all line up in a row,
            using the size of the content as their size in the main axis. If
            there are more items than can fit in the container, they will not
            wrap but will instead overflow. If some items are taller than
            others, all items will stretch along the cross axis to fill its full
            size.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can see in the live example below how this looks. Try editing
            the items or adding additional items in order to test the initial
            behavior of flexbox.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-7.png" />
          <h4>Changing flex-direction</h4>
          <p>
            Adding the flex-direction property to the flex container allows us
            to change the direction in which our flex items display. Setting
            flex-direction: row-reverse will keep the items displaying along the
            row, however the start and end lines are switched.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we change flex-direction to column the main axis switches and our
            items now display in a column. Set column-reverse and the start and
            end lines are again switched.
          </p>

          <p>
            The live example below has flex-direction set to row-reverse. Try
            the other values — row, column and column-reverse — to see what
            happens to the content.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-8.png" />
          <h4>Multi-line flex containers with flex-wrap</h4>
          <p>
            While flexbox is a one dimensional model, it is possible to cause
            our flex items to wrap onto multiple lines. In doing so, you should
            consider each line as a new flex container. Any space distribution
            will happen across that line, without reference to the lines on
            either side.
          </p>
          <p>
            To cause wrapping behavior add the property flex-wrap with a value
            of wrap. Now, should your items be too large to all display in one
            line, they will wrap onto another line. The live sample below
            contains items that have been given a width, the total width of the
            items being too wide for the flex container. As flex-wrap is set to
            wrap, the items wrap. Set it to nowrap, which is also the initial
            value, and they will instead shrink to fit the container because
            they are using initial flexbox values that allows items to shrink.
            Using nowrap would cause an overflow if the items were not able to
            shrink, or could not shrink small enough to fit.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-9.png" />
          <p>
            Find out more about wrapping flex items in the guide Mastering
            Wrapping of Flex Items.
          </p>
          <h4>The flex-flow shorthand</h4>
          <p>
            You can combine the two properties flex-direction and flex-wrap into
            the flex-flow shorthand. The first value specified is flex-direction
            and the second value is flex-wrap.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the live example below try changing the first value to one of the
            allowable values for flex-direction - row, row-reverse, column or
            column-reverse, and also change the second to wrap and nowrap.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-10.png" />
          <h4>Properties applied to flex items</h4>
          <p>
            To have more control over flex items we can target them directly. We
            do this by way of three properties:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>flex-grow</li>
            <li>flex-shrink</li>
            <li>flex-basis</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We will take a brief look at these properties in this overview, and
            you can gain a fuller understanding in the guide Controlling Ratios
            of Flex Items on the Main Axis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we can make sense of these properties we need to consider the
            concept of available space. What we are doing when we change the
            value of these flex properties is to change the way that available
            space is distributed amongst our items. This concept of available
            space is also important when we come to look at aligning items.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we have three 100 pixel-wide items in a container which is 500
            pixels wide, then the space we need to lay out our items is 300
            pixels. This leaves 200 pixels of available space. If we don't
            change the initial values then flexbox will put that space after the
            last item.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-11.png" />
          <p>
            If we instead would like the items to grow and fill the space, then
            we need to have a method of distributing the leftover space between
            the items. This is what the flex properties that we apply to the
            items themselves, will do.
          </p>
          <h4>The flex-basis property</h4>
          <p>
            The flex-basis is what defines the size of that item in terms of the
            space it leaves as available space. The initial value of this
            property is auto — in this case the browser looks to see if the
            items have a size. In the example above, all of the items have a
            width of 100 pixels and so this is used as the flex-basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the items don't have a size then the content's size is used as
            the flex-basis. This is why when we just declare display: flex on
            the parent to create flex items, the items all move into a row and
            take only as much space as they need to display their contents.
          </p>
          <h4>The flex-grow property</h4>
          <p>
            With the flex-grow property set to a positive integer, flex items
            can grow along the main axis from their flex-basis. This will cause
            the item to stretch and take up any available space on that axis, or
            a proportion of the available space if other items are allowed to
            grow too.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we gave all of our items in the example above a flex-grow value
            of 1 then the available space in the flex container would be equally
            shared between our items and they would stretch to fill the
            container on the main axis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flex-grow property can be used to distribute space in
            proportion. If we give our first item a flex-grow value of 2, and
            the other items a value of 1 each, 2 parts of the available space
            will be given to the first item (100px out of 200px in the case of
            the example above), 1 part each the other two (50px each out of the
            200px total).
          </p>
          <h4>The flex-shrink property</h4>
          <p>
            Where the flex-grow property deals with adding space in the main
            axis, the flex-shrink property controls how it is taken away. If we
            do not have enough space in the container to lay out our items, and
            flex-shrink is set to a positive integer, then the item can become
            smaller than the flex-basis. As with flex-grow, different values can
            be assigned in order to cause one item to shrink faster than others
            — an item with a higher value set for flex-shrink will shrink faster
            than its siblings that have lower values.
          </p>
          <p>
            The minimum size of the item will be taken into account while
            working out the actual amount of shrinkage that will happen, which
            means that flex-shrink has the potential to appear less consistent
            than flex-grow in behavior. We'll therefore take a more detailed
            look at how this algorithm works in the article Controlling Ratios
            of items along the main axis.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will very rarely see the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis
            properties used individually; instead they are combined into the
            flex shorthand. The flex shorthand allows you to set the three
            values in this order — flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The live example below allows you to test out the different values
            of the flex shorthand; remember that the first value is flex-grow.
            Giving this a positive value means the item can grow. The second is
            flex-shrink — with a positive value the items can shrink, but only
            if their total values overflow the main axis. The final value is
            flex-basis; this is the value the items are using as their base
            value to grow and shrink from.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-12.png" />
          <p>
            There are also some predefined shorthand values which cover most of
            the use cases. You will often see these used in tutorials, and in
            many cases these are all you will need to use. The predefined values
            are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>flex:inital</li>
            <li>flex:auto</li>
            <li>flex:none</li>
            <li>flex: positive nomber</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Setting flex: initial resets the item to the initial values of
            Flexbox. This is the same as flex: 0 1 auto. In this case the value
            of flex-grow is 0, so items will not grow larger than their
            flex-basis size. The value of flex-shrink is 1, so items can shrink
            if they need to rather than overflowing. The value of flex-basis is
            auto. Items will either use any size set on the item in the main
            dimension, or they will get their size from the content size.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using flex: auto is the same as using flex: 1 1 auto; everything is
            as with flex:initial but in this case the items can grow and fill
            the container as well as shrink if required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using flex: none will create fully inflexible flex items. It is as
            if you wrote flex: 0 0 auto. The items cannot grow or shrink but
            will be laid out using flexbox with a flex-basis of auto.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shorthand you often see in tutorials is flex: 1 or flex: 2 and
            so on. This is as if you used flex: 1 1 0 or flex: 2 1 0 and so on,
            respectively. The items can grow and shrink from a flex-basis of 0.
          </p>
          <p>Try these shorthand values in the live example below.</p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-13.png" />
          <h3>
            Alignment, justification and distribution of free space between
            items
          </h3>
          <p>
            A key feature of flexbox is the ability to align and justify items
            on the main- and cross-axes, and to distribute space between flex
            items. Note that these properties are to be set on the flex
            container, not on the items themselves.
          </p>
          <h4>align-items</h4>
          <p>
            The align-items property will align the items on the cross axis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The initial value for this property is stretch and this is why flex
            items stretch to the height of the flex container by default. This
            might be dictated by the height of the tallest item in the
            container, or by a size set on the flex container itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could instead set align-items to flex-start in order to make the
            items line up at the start of the flex container, flex-end to align
            them to the end, or center to align them in the center. Try this in
            the live example — I have given the flex container a height in order
            that you can see how the items can be moved around inside the
            container. See what happens if you set the value of align-items to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>stretch</li>
            <li>flex-start</li>
            <li>flex-end</li>
            <li>center</li>
          </ul>
          <img src="./images/flebox-14.png" />
          <h4>justify-content</h4>
          <p>
            The justify-content property is used to align the items on the main
            axis, the direction in which flex-direction has set the flow. The
            initial value is flex-start which will line the items up at the
            start edge of the container, but you could also set the value to
            flex-end to line them up at the end, or center to line them up in
            the center.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also use the value space-between to take all the spare space
            after the items have been laid out, and share it out evenly between
            the items so there will be an equal amount of space between each
            item. To cause an equal amount of space on the right and left of
            each item use the value space-around. With space-around, items have
            a half-size space on either end. Or, to cause items to have equal
            space around them use the value space-evenly. With space-evenly,
            items have a full-size space on either end.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>flex-start</li>
            <li>flex-end</li>
            <li>center</li>
            <li>space-around</li>
            <li>space-between</li>
            <li>space-evenly</li>
          </ul>

            In the article Aligning Items in a Flex Container we will explore
            these properties in more depth, in order to have a better
            understanding of how they work. These simple examples however will
            be useful in the majority of use cases.

          <h3>Relationship of flexbox to other layout methods</h3>
          <p>
            In this article we will take a look at how Flexbox fits in with all
            the other CSS modules. We'll find out which specifications you also
            need to take notice of if you want to learn flexbox, and find out
            why flexbox is different to some other modules.
          </p>
          <h4>The box alignment module</h4>
          <p>
            For many people the first reason they start to look at flexbox is
            because of the ability to properly align flex items inside a flex
            container. Flexbox provides access to properties that allow the
            alignment of items on their cross axis and justification of items on
            the main axis.
          </p>
          <p>
            These properties started life in the flexbox specification, but are
            now also part of the Box Alignment Specification. This specification
            details how alignment works in all layout — not just flexbox. Box
            alignment deals with alignment and justification, including creating
            gaps or gutters between flex items.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason that the Box alignment properties remain detailed in the
            flexbox specification as well as being in box alignment is to ensure
            that completion of the flexbox spec is not held up by box alignment,
            which has to detail these methods for all layout types. There is a
            note in the flexbox spec stating that in the future, once it is
            completed, the definitions in Box Alignment Level 3 will supersede
            those of flexbox:
          </p>
          <p>
            <q
              >"Note: While the alignment properties are defined in CSS Box
              Alignment [CSS-ALIGN-3], Flexible Box Layout reproduces the
              definitions of the relevant ones here so as to not create a
              normative dependency that may slow down advancement of the spec.
              These properties apply only to flex layout until CSS Box Alignment
              Level 3 is finished and defines their effect for other layout
              modes. Additionally, any new values defined in the Box Alignment
              module will apply to Flexible Box Layout; in other words, the Box
              Alignment module, once completed, will supersede the definitions
              here."
            </q>
          </p>
          <p>
            In a later article in this series — Aligning items in a flex
            container — we will take a thorough look at how the Box Alignment
            properties apply to flex items.
          </p>
          <h3>Writing modes</h3>
          <p>
            In the Basic concepts of flexbox article, I explained that flexbox
            is writing mode aware. Writing modes are fully detailed in the CSS
            Writing Modes specification, which details how CSS supports the
            various different writing modes that exist internationally. We need
            to be aware of how this will impact our flex layouts as writing mode
            changes the direction that blocks are laid out in our document.
            Understanding block and inline directions is key to new layout
            methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is worth noting that we might want to change the writing mode of
            our document for reasons other than publishing content in a language
            that uses a different writing mode. See this article for a full
            description of writing modes and ways to use them, both for content
            in other languages and for creative reasons.
          </p>
          <h4>the writing modes</h4>
          <p>
            The writing modes specification defines the following values of the
            writing-mode property, which serve to change the direction that
            blocks are laid out on the page, to match the direction that blocks
            lay out when content is formatted in that particular writing mode.
            You can change the live example below to these modes in order to see
            what happens to the flex layout.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>horizontal-tb</li>
            <li>vertical-rl</li>
            <li>vertical-lr</li>
            <li>sideways-rl</li>
            <li>sideways-lr</li>
          </ul>
          <img src="./images/flebox-box-1.png" />
          <p>
            Note that sideways-rl and sideways-lr have support only in Firefox
            currently. There are also some known issues with regard to
            writing-mode and flexbox. You can see more information on browser
            support in the MDN documentation for writing-mode. However if you
            are planning on using writing modes in your layout, carefully
            testing the results is advisable — not least because it would be
            easy to make things hard to read!
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that you would not normally use CSS and the writing-mode
            property to change an entire document to another writing mode. This
            would be done via HTML, by adding a dir and lang attribute to the
            html element to indicate the document language and default text
            direction. This would mean that the document would display correctly
            even if CSS did not load.
          </p>
          <h3>Flexbox and other layout methods</h3>
          <p>
            The flexbox specification contains a definition of what happens if
            an item uses another layout method and then becomes a flex item. For
            example, if an item is floated and then its parent becomes a flex
            container. Or, how a flex container behaves as part of layout.
          </p>
          <p>
            An element set to display: flex behaves in most ways like any other
            block level container that establishes a containing block. Floats
            will not intrude, and the containers' margins will not collapse.
          </p>
          <p>
            With regard to flex items, if an item was floated or cleared and
            then becomes a flex item due to the parent having display: flex
            applied, the floating and clearing will no longer happen, and the
            item will not be taken out of normal flow in the way that floats
            are. If you have used the vertical-align property, as used with
            inline-block or table layout for alignment, this will no longer
            affect the item and you can use the alignment properties of flexbox
            instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this next live example the child elements have been floated, and
            then their container has had display: flex added. If you remove
            display: flex, you should see that the .box element collapses as we
            have no clearing applied. This demonstrates that the float is
            happening. Re-apply display: flex and the collapsing does not
            happen. This is because the items no longer have a float applied, as
            they have been transformed into flex items.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-box-2.png" />
          <h3>Flexbox and Grid Layout</h3>
          <p>
            CSS Grid Layout and Flexbox generally act in the same way with
            regards to overwriting other methods. You might however want to use
            flexbox as a fallback for grid layout, as there is better support
            for flexbox in older browsers. This approach works very well. If a
            flex item becomes a grid item, then the flex properties that may
            have been assigned to the child elements will be ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use the Box Alignment properties across both layout methods,
            so using flexbox as a fallback for grid layout can work very well.
          </p>
          <h4>Flex and grid — what's the difference?</h4>
          <p>
            A common question is to ask what the difference is between Flexbox
            and CSS Grid Layout — why do we have two specifications that
            sometimes appear to be doing the same thing?
          </p>
          <p>
            The most straightforward answer to this question is defined in the
            specifications themselves. Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout
            method whereas Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout method. The
            example below has a flex layout. As already described in the Basic
            concepts article, flex items can be allowed to wrap but, once they
            do so, each line becomes a flex container of its own. When space is
            distributed flexbox does not look at the placement of items in other
            rows and tries to line things up with each other.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-box-3.png" />
          <p>
            If we create a very similar layout using Grid, we can control the
            layout in both rows and columns.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flebox-box-4.png" />
          <p>
            These examples point to another key difference between these layout
            methods. In Grid Layout you do the majority of sizing specification
            on the container, setting up tracks and then placing items into
            them. In flexbox, while you create a flex container and set the
            direction at that level, any control over item sizing needs to
            happen on the items themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases you could happily use either layout method, but as you
            become confident with both you will find each one suiting different
            layout needs, and you will end up with both methods in your CSS.
            There is rarely a right or wrong answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a rule of thumb, if you are adding widths to flex items in order
            to make items in one row of a wrapped flex container line up with
            the items above them you really want two-dimensional layout. In this
            case it is likely that the component would be better laid out using
            CSS Grid Layout. It isn't the case that you should use flexbox for
            small components and grid layout for larger ones; a tiny component
            can be two dimensional, and a large layout can be represented better
            with layout in one dimension. Try things out — we have a choice in
            layout method for the first time, so take advantage of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            For more comparisons of grid and flexbox see the article
            Relationship of Grid Layout to other layout methods. This article
            details many of the ways that Grid Layout differs from flex layout,
            and demonstrates some of the extra functionality you get when using
            Grid Layout such as layering of items on the grid. This may also
            help in your decision as to which layout method to use.
          </p>
          <h3>Flexbox and display: contents</h3>
          <p>
            The contents value of the display property is a new value that is
            described in the spec as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            <q
              >"The element itself does not generate any boxes, but its children
              and pseudo-elements still generate boxes as normal. For the
              purposes of box generation and layout, the element must be treated
              as if it had been replaced with its children and pseudo-elements
              in the document tree."
            </q>
          </p>
          <p>
            This value of display controls box generation, and whether the
            element should generate a box that we can style and see on the page,
            or whether instead the box it would normally create should be
            removed and the child elements essentially moved up to participate
            in whatever layout method the parent would have been part of. This
            is much easier to see with an example.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the following live example I have a flex container with three
            child elements. One of these flex items has two elements nested
            inside it, which would not ordinarily participate in flex layout.
            Flex layout only applies to the direct children of a flex container.
          </p>
          <p>
            By adding display: contents to the wrapper around the nested
            elements, you can see that the item has disappeared from the layout,
            allowing the two sub-children to be laid out as if they were direct
            children of the flex container. You can try removing the display:
            contents line to see it return.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that this only removes the box from the layout; the
            sub-children don't become direct children in any other way. You can
            see that as I have used a direct child selector to add the
            background and borders to the flex items, this has not been applied
            to our nested children. They have been laid out as flex items, but
            as they are not direct children they do not get the other styling.
          </p>
          <p class="warningtext">
            Warning: Current implementations in most browsers will remove any
            element with display: contents from the accessibility tree (but
            descendants will remain). This will cause the element itself to no
            longer be announced by screen reading technology. This is incorrect
            behavior according to the specification, see display: contents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, having removed the box you cannot then use it to — for example
            — add a background color behind the nested sub children. If you
            remove display: contents in this live example you will see that the
            direct child we are removing has an orange background color. This
            also disappears when the box disappears.

            Browser support for display:contents is limited and required for
            this demo to work. Firefox supports display: contents already, and
            the value is being implemented in Chrome. Once there is better
            browser support this feature will be very useful in circumstances
            where you need the markup for semantic reasons but do not want to
            display the box that it would generate by default.

          <h3>Aligning Items in a Flex Container</h3>
          <p>
            One of the reasons that flexbox quickly caught the interest of web
            developers is that it brought proper alignment capabilities to the
            web for the first time. It enabled proper vertical alignment, so we
            can at last easily center a box. In this guide, we will take a
            thorough look at how the alignment and justification properties work
            in Flexbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            To center our box we use the align-items property to align our item
            on the cross axis, which in this case is the block axis running
            vertically. We use justify-content to align the item on the main
            axis, which in this case is the inline axis running horizontally.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-1.png" />
          <p>
            You can take a look at the code of this example below. Change the
            size of the container or nested element and the nested element
            always remains centered.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-2.png" />
          <h4>Properties that control alignment</h4>
          <p>The properties we will look at in this guide are as follows.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              justify-content — controls alignment of all items on the main
              axis.
            </li>
            <li>
              align-items — controls alignment of all items on the cross axis.
            </li>
            <li>
              align-self — controls alignment of an individual flex item on the
              cross axis.
            </li>
            <li>
              align-content — described in the spec as for "packing flex lines";
              controls space between flex lines on the cross axis.
            </li>
            <li>
              gap, column-gap, and row-gap — used to create gaps or gutters
              between flex items.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We will also discover how auto margins can be used for alignment in
            flexbox.
          </p>
          <h4>The Cross Axis</h4>
          <p>
            The align-items and align-self properties control alignment of our
            flex items on the cross axis, down the columns if flex-direction is
            row and along the row if flex-direction is column.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are making use of cross-axis alignment in the most simple flex
            example. If we add display: flex to a container, the child items all
            become flex items arranged in a row. They will all stretch to be as
            tall as the tallest item, as that item is defining the height of the
            items on the cross axis. If your flex container has a height set,
            then the items will stretch to that height, regardless of how much
            content is in the item.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-3.png" />
          <img src="./images/flex-container-4.png" />
          <p>
            The reason the items become the same height is that the initial
            value of align-items, the property that controls alignment on the
            cross axis, is set to stretch.
          </p>
          <p>We can use other values to control how the items align:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>align-items: flex-start</li>
            <li>align-items: flex-end</li>
            <li>align-items: center</li>
            <li>align-items: stretch</li>
            <li>align-items: baseline</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In the live example below, the value of align-items is stretch. Try
            the other values and see how all of the items align against each
            other in the flex container.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-5.png" />
          <h4>Aligning one item with align-self</h4>
          <p>
            The align-items property sets the align-self property on all of the
            flex items as a group. This means you can explicitly declare the
            align-self property to target a single item. The align-self property
            accepts all of the same values as align-items plus a value of auto,
            which will reset the value to that which is defined on the flex
            container.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this next live example, the flex container has align-items:
            flex-start, which means the items are all aligned to the start of
            the cross axis. I have targeted the first item using a first-child
            selector and set that item to align-self: stretch; another item has
            been selected using its class of selected and given align-self:
            center. You can change the value of align-items or change the values
            of align-self on the individual items to see how this works.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-6.png" />
          <h4>Changing the main axis</h4>
          <p>
            So far we have looked at the behavior when our flex-direction is
            row, and while working in a language written top to bottom. This
            means that the main axis runs along the row horizontally, and our
            cross axis alignment moves the items up and down.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-7.png" />
          <p>
            If we change our flex-direction to column, align-items and
            align-self will align the items to the left and right.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-8.png" />
          <p>
            You can try this out in the example below, which has a flex
            container with flex-direction: column yet otherwise is exactly the
            same as the previous example.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-9.png" />
          <h4>
            Aligning content on the cross axis — the align-content property
          </h4>
          <p>
            So far we have been aligning the items, or an individual item inside
            the area defined by the flex-container. If you have a wrapped
            multiple-line flex container then you might also want to use the
            align-content property to control the distribution of space between
            the rows. In the specification this is described as packing flex
            lines.
          </p>
          <p>
            For align-content to work you need more height in your flex
            container than is required to display the items. It then works on
            all the items as a set, and dictates what happens with that free
            space, and the alignment of the entire set of items within it.
          </p>
          <p>The align-content property takes the following values:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>align-content: flex-start</li>
            <li>align-content: flex-end</li>
            <li>align-content: center</li>
            <li>align-content: space-between</li>
            <li>align-content: space-around</li>
            <li>align-content: stretch</li>
            <li>
              align-content: space-evenly (not defined in the Flexbox
              specification)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In the live example below, the flex container has a height of 400
            pixels, which is more than needed to display our items. The value of
            align-content is space-between, which means that the available space
            is shared out between the flex lines, which are placed flush with
            the start and end of the container on the cross axis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try out the other values to see how the align-content property
            works.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-10.png" />
          <p>
            Once again we can switch our flex-direction to column in order to
            see how this property behaves when we are working by column. As
            before, we need enough space in the cross axis to have some free
            space after displaying all of the items.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-11.png" />
          <p class="notecontent">
            Note: The value space-evenly is not defined in the flexbox
            specification and is a later addition to the Box Alignment
            specification. Browser support for this value is not as good as that
            of the values defined in the flexbox spec.
          </p>
          <h4>Aligning content on the main axis</h4>
          <p>
            Now that we have seen how alignment works on the cross axis, we can
            take a look at the main axis. Here we only have one property
            available to us — justify-content. This is because we are only
            dealing with items as a group on the main axis. With justify-content
            we control what happens with available space, should there be more
            space than is needed to display the items.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our initial example with display: flex on the container, the
            items display as a row and all line up at the start of the
            container. This is due to the initial value of justify-content being
            flex-start. Any available space is placed at the end of the items.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-11.png" />
          <p>
            The justify-content property accepts the same values as
            align-content.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>justify-content: flex-start</li>
            <li>justify-content: flex-end</li>
            <li>justify-content: center</li>
            <li>justify-content: space-between</li>
            <li>justify-content: space-around</li>
            <li>
              justify-content: space-evenly (not defined in the Flexbox
              specification)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In the example below, the value of justify-content is space-between.
            The available space after displaying the items is distributed
            between the items. The left and right item line up flush with the
            start and end.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-12.png" />
          <p>
            If the main axis is in the block direction because flex-direction is
            set to column, then justify-content will distribute space between
            items in that dimension as long as there is space in the flex
            container to distribute.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-13.png" />
          <h4>Alignment and Writing Modes</h4>
          <p>
            Remember that with all of these alignment methods, the values of
            flex-start and flex-end are writing mode-aware. If the value of
            justify-content is flex-start and the writing mode is left-to-right
            as in English, the items will line up starting at the left side of
            the container.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-14.png" />
          <p>
            However if the writing mode is right-to-left as in Arabic, the items
            will line up starting at the right side of the container.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-15.png" />
          <p>
            The live example below has the direction property set to rtl to
            force a right-to-left flow for our items. You can remove this, or
            change the values of justify-content to see how flexbox behaves when
            the start of the inline direction is on the right.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-16.png" />
          <h4>Alignment and flex-direction</h4>
          <p>
            The start line will also change if you change the flex-direction
            property — for example using row-reverse instead of row.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this next example I have items laid out with flex-direction:
            row-reverse and justify-content: flex-end. In a left to right
            language the items all line up on the left. Try changing
            flex-direction: row-reverse to flex-direction: row. You will see
            that the items now move to the right-hand side.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-17.png" />
          <p>
            While this may all seem a little confusing, the rule to remember is
            that unless you do something to change it, flex items lay themselves
            out in the direction that words are laid out in the language of your
            document along the inline, row axis. flex-start will be where the
            start of a sentence of text would begin.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-18.png" />
          <p>
            You can switch them to display in the block direction for the
            language of your document by selecting flex-direction: column. Then
            flex-start will then be where the top of your first paragraph of
            text would start.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-19.png" />
          <p>
            If you change flex-direction to one of the reverse values, then they
            will lay themselves out from the end axis and in the reverse order
            to the way words are written in the language of your document.
            flex-start will then change to the end of that axis — so to the
            location where your lines would wrap if working in rows, or at the
            end of your last paragraph of text in the block direction.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-20.png" />
          <img src="./images/flex-container-21.png" />
          <h4>Using auto margins for main axis alignment</h4>
          <p>
            We don't have a justify-items or justify-self property available to
            us on the main axis as our items are treated as a group on that
            axis. However it is possible to do some individual alignment in
            order to separate an item or a group of items from others by using
            auto margins along with flexbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            A common pattern is a navigation bar where some key items are
            aligned to the right, with the main group on the left. You might
            think that this should be a use case for a justify-self property,
            however consider the image below. I have three items on one side and
            two on the other. If I were able to use justify-self on item d, it
            would also change the alignment of item e that follows, which may or
            may not be my intention.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-22.png" />
          <p>
            Instead we can target item 4 and separate it from the first three
            items by giving it a margin-left value of auto. Auto margins will
            take up all of the space that they can in their axis — it is how
            centering a block with margin auto left and right works. Each side
            tries to take as much space as it can, and so the block is pushed
            into the middle.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this live example, I have flex items arranged into a row with the
            basic flex values, and the class push has margin-left: auto. You can
            try removing this, or adding the class to another item to see how it
            works.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-container-23.png" />
          <h4>Creating gaps between items</h4>
          <p>
            To create a gap between flex items, use the gap, column-gap, and
            row-gap properties. The column-gap property creates gaps between
            items on the main axis. The row-gap property creates gaps between
            flex lines, when you have flex-wrap set to wrap. The gap property is
