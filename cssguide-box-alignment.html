              The CSS Box Alignment module specifies CSS features that relate to
              the alignment of boxes in the various CSS box layout models: block
              layout, table layout, flex layout, and grid layout. The module
              aims to create a consistent method of alignment across all of CSS.
              This document details the general concepts found in the
              specification.

          <h3>Key concepts and terminology</h3>
          <p>
            The specification details some alignment terminology to make it
            easier to discuss these alignment properties outside of their
            implementation within a particular layout method. There are also
            some key concepts which are common to all layout methods.
          </p>
          <h4>Relationship to writing modes</h4>
          <p>
            Alignment is linked to writing modes in that when we align an item
            we do not consider whether we are aligning it to the physical
            dimensions of top, right, bottom and left. Instead we describe
            alignment in terms of the start and end of the particular dimension
            we are working with. This ensures that alignment works in the same
            way whichever writing mode the document has.
          </p>
          <h4>Two dimensions of alignment</h4>
          <p>
            When using the box alignment properties you will align content on
            one of two axes — the inline (or main) axis, and the block (or
            cross) axis. The inline axis is the axis along which words in a
            sentence flow in the writing mode being used — for English, for
            example, the inline axis is horizontal. The block axis is the axis
            along which blocks, such as paragraph elements, are laid out and it
            runs across the Inline axis.
          </p>
          <img
            src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Alignment/two-axes.png"
          />
          <p>
            When aligning items on the inline axis you will use the properties
            which begin with justify-:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>justify-items</li>
            <li>justify-self</li>
            <li>justify-content</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When aligning items on the block axis you will use the properties
            that begin align-:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>align-items</li>
            <li>align-self</li>
            <li>align-content</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Flexbox adds an additional complication in that the above is true
            when flex-direction is set to row. The properties are swapped when
            flexbox is set to column. Therefore, when working with flexbox it is
            easier to think about the main and cross axis rather than inline and
            block. The justify- properties are always used to align on the main
            axis, the align- properties on the cross axis.
          </p>
          <h4>The alignment subject</h4>
          <p>
            The alignment subject is the thing that is being aligned. For
            justify-self or align-self, or when setting these values as a group
            with justify-items or align-items, this will be the margin box of
            the element that this property is being used on. The justify-content
            and align-content properties differ per layout method.
          </p>

          <h4>The alignment container</h4>
          <p>
            The alignment container is the box the subject is being aligned
            inside. This will typically be the alignment subject's containing
            block. An alignment container may contain one or many alignment
            subjects.
            <br />
            The below image shows an alignment container with two alignment
            subjects inside.
          </p>
          <img
            src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Alignment/align-container-subjects.png"
          />
          <h4>Fallback alignment</h4>
          <p>
            If you set an alignment that cannot be fulfilled, then the fallback
            alignment will come into play and deal with the available space.
            This fallback alignment is specified individually for each layout
            method and detailed on the page for that method.
          </p>
          <h3>Types of alignment</h3>
          <p>
            There are three different types of alignment that the specification
            details; these use keyword values.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Positional alignment: <br />
              specifying the position of an alignment subject with relation to
              its alignment container.
            </li>
            <li>
              Baseline alignment: <br />
              These keywords define alignment as a relationship among the
              baselines of multiple alignment subjects within an alignment
              context.
            </li>
            <li>
              Distributed alignment: <br />
              These keywords define alignment as a distribution of space among
              alignment subjects.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Positional alignment keyword values</h3>
          <p>
            The following values are defined for positional alignment, and can
            be used as values for content alignment with justify-content and
            align-content and also for self alignment with justify-self and
            align-self.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>center</li>
            <li>start</li>
            <li>end</li>
            <li>self-start</li>
            <li>flex-start</li>
            <li>flex-end</li>
            <li>left</li>
            <li>right</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Other than the physical values of left and right, which relate to
            physical attributes of the screen, all of the other values are
            logical values and relate to the writing mode of the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, when working in CSS Grid Layout, if you are working in
            English and set justify-content to start this will move the items in
            the inline dimension to the start, which will be the left as
            sentences in English start on the left. If you were using Arabic, a
            right to left language, then the same value of start would result in
            the items moving to the right, as sentences in Arabic start on the
            right-hand side of the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of these examples have justify-content: start, however the
            location of start changes according to the writing mode.
          </p>
          <img
            src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Alignment/writing-mode-start.png"
          />
          <h4>Baseline alignment</h4>
          <p>
            The Baseline alignment keywords are used to align the baselines of
            boxes across a group of alignment subjects. They can be used as
            values for content alignment with justify-content and align-content
            and also for self alignment with justify-self and align-self.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>baseline</li>
            <li>first baseline</li>
            <li>last baseline</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Baseline content alignment — specifying a baseline alignment value
            for justify-content or align-content — works in layout methods that
            lay items out in rows. The alignment subjects are baseline aligned
            against each other by adding padding inside the boxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Baseline self alignment shifts the boxes to align by baseline by
            adding a margin outside the boxes. Self alignment is when using
            justify-self or align-self, or when setting these values as a group
            with justify-items and align-items.
          </p>
          <h4>Distributed alignment</h4>
          <p>
            The distributed alignment keywords are used with the align-content
            and justify-content properties. These keywords define what happens
            to any additional space after alignment subjects have been
            displayed. The values are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>stretch</li>
            <li>space-between</li>
            <li>space-around</li>
            <li>space-evenly</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, in Flex Layout items are aligned with flex-start
            initially. Working in a horizontal top to bottom writing mode such
            as English, with flex-direction as row the items start on the far
            left and any available space after displaying the items is placed
            after the items.
          </p>
          <img
            src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Alignment/justify-content-start.png"
          />
          <p>
            If you set justify-content: space-between on the flex container, the
            available space is now shared out and placed between the items.
          </p>
          <img
            src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Alignment/justify-content-space-between.png"
          />
          <p>
            There needs to be space available in the dimension you wish to align
            the items in, in order for these keywords to take effect. With no
            space, there is nothing to distribute.
          </p>
          <h4>Overflow alignment</h4>
          <p>
            The safe and unsafe keywords help define behavior when an alignment
            subject is larger than the alignment container. The safe keyword
            will align to start in the case of a specified alignment causing an
            overflow, the aim being to avoid "data loss" where part of the item
            is outside of the boundaries of the alignment container and can't be
            scrolled to.
          </p>
          <h4>Gaps between boxes</h4>
          <p>
            The box alignment specification also includes the gap, row-gap, and
            column-gap properties. These properties enable the setting of a
            consistent gap between items in a row or column, in any layout
            method which has items arranged in this way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The gap property is a shorthand for row-gap and column-gap, which
            allows us to set these properties at once:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>row-gap</li>
            <li>column-gap</li>
            <li>gap</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Be aware that other things may increase the visual gap displayed,
            for example using the space distribution keywords or adding margins
            to items.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the below example, a grid layout uses the gap shorthand to set a
            10px gap between row tracks, and a 2em gap between column tracks.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/gap-1.PNG" />
          <hr />
          <h3>Older alignment methods</h3>
          <p>
            CSS traditionally had very limited alignment capabilities. We were
            able to align text using text-align, center blocks using auto
            margins, and in table or inline-block layouts using the
            vertical-align property. Alignment of text is now covered by the
            Inline Layout and CSS Text modules, and for the first time in Box
            Alignment we have full horizontal and vertical alignment
            capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you specify unsafe then the alignment will be honoured even if it
            would cause such data loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you initially learned Flexbox then you may consider these
            properties to be part of the Flexbox specification, and some of the
            properties are indeed listed in Level 1 of Flexbox. However the
            specification notes that the Box Alignment specification should be
            referred to as it may add additional capabilities over what is
            currently in Flexbox.

          <h3>CSS grid layout alignment example</h3>
          <p>
            In this example using Grid Layout, there is extra space in the grid
            container after laying out the fixed width tracks on the inline
            (main) axis. This space is distributed using justify-content. On the
            block (cross) axis the alignment of the items inside their grid
            areas is controlled with align-items. The first item overrides the
            align-items value set on the group by setting align-self to center.

          <h3>Flexbox Alignment Example</h3>
          <p>
            In this example, three flex items are aligned on the main axis using
            justify-content and on the Cross Axis using align-items. The first
            item overrides the align-items set on the group by setting
            align-self to center.

            Box alignment for block, absolutely positioned and table layout
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Box Alignment Specification details how alignment works in
            various layout methods. In this page we explore how box alignment
            works in the context of block layout, including floated, positioned,
            and table elements. As this page aims to detail things which are
            specific to block layout and box alignment, it should be read in
            conjunction with the main Box Alignment page, which details the
            common features of box alignment across layout methods.
          </p>
          <h3>align-content and justify-content</h3>
          <p>
            The justify-content property does not apply to block containers or
            table cells.
          </p>
          <p>
            The align-content property applies to the block axis in order to
            align the contents of the box within its container. If a content
            distribution method such as space-between, space-around or
            space-evenly is requested then the fallback alignment will be used,
            as the content is treated as a single alignment subject.
          </p>
          <h3>justify-self</h3>
          <p>
            The justify-self property is used to align an item inside its
            containing block on the inline axis.
          </p>
          <p>
            This property does not apply to floated elements or table cells.
          </p>
          <h3>align-self</h3>
          <p>
            The align-self property does not apply to block-level boxes
            (including floats), because there is more than one item in the block
            axis. It also does not apply to table cells.
          </p>
          <h3>Absolutely positioned elements</h3>
          <p>
            The alignment container is the positioned block, accounting for the
            offset values of top, left, bottom, and right. The normal keyword
            resolves to stretch, unless the positioned item is a replaced
            element, in which case it resolves to start.
          </p>
          <h3>Aligning in these layout methods today</h3>
          <p>
            As we do not currently have browser support for box alignment in
            block layout, your options for alignment are either to use one of
            the existing alignment methods or, to make even a single item inside
            a container a flex item in order to use the alignment properties as
            specified in flexbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alignment of blocks horizontally prior to flexbox was typically
            achieved by way of setting auto margins on the block. A margin of
            auto will absorb all available space in that dimension, therefore
            setting a left and right margin of auto, you can push a block into
            the center:
          </p>
          <p class="codeblack">
            .container { <br />
            width: 20em; <br />
            margin-left: auto; <br />
            margin-right: auto; <br />
            }
          </p>
          <p>
            In table layout, you have access to the vertical-align property to
            align the contents of a cell inside that cell.
          </p>
          <p>
            For many use cases, turning the block container into a flex item
            will give you the alignment capability that you are looking for. In
            the example below, a container with a single item inside has been
            turned into a flex container for the purpose of being able to use
            the alignment properties.

          <h3>Box alignment in Flexbox</h3>
          <p>
            The Box Alignment Specification details how alignment works in
            various layout methods; on this page, we explore how box alignment
            works in the context of Flexbox. As this page aims to detail things
            which are specific to Flexbox and box alignment, it should be read
            in conjunction with the main Box Alignment page which details the
            common features of box alignment across layout methods.
          </p>
          <h4>Basic example</h4>
          <p>
            In this example, three flex items are aligned on the main axis using
            justify-content and on the cross axis using align-items. The first
            item overrides the align-items values set on the group by setting
            align-self to center.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-alignment-3.PNG" />
          <h3>The axes and flex-direction</h3>
          <p>
            Flexbox respects the writing mode of the document, therefore if you
            are working in English and set justify-content to flex-end this will
            align the items to the end of the flex container. If you are working
            with flex-direction set to row, this alignment will be in the inline
            direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in Flexbox you can change the main axis by setting
            flex-direction to column. In this case, justify-content will align
            items in the block direction. Therefore it is easiest to think about
            the main and cross axis when working in Flexbox like so:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The main axis = direction set by flex-direction = alignment via
              justify-content
            </li>
            <li>
              The cross axis = runs across the main axis = alignment via
              align-content, align-self/align-items
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Main Axis Alignment</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>justify-content</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <h4>Cross Axis Alignment</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>align-self</li>
            <li>align-items</li>
            <li>align-content</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>There is no justify-self in Flexbox</h4>
          <p>
            On the main axis, Flexbox deals with our content as a group. The
            amount of space required to lay out the items is calculated, and the
            leftover space is then available for distribution. The
            justify-content property controls how that leftover space is used.
            Set justify-content: flex-end and the extra space is placed before
            the items, justify-content: space-around and it is placed either
            side of the item in that dimension, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that a justify-self property does not make sense in
            Flexbox as we are always dealing with moving the entire group of
            items around.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the cross axis align-self makes sense as we potentially have
            additional space in the flex container in that dimension, in which a
            single item can be moved to the start and end.
          </p>
          <h3>Alignment and auto margins</h3>
          <p>
            There is a specific use case in Flexbox where we might think that a
            justify-self property is what we need, and this is when we want to
            split a set of flex items, perhaps to create a split navigation
            pattern. For this use case, we can use an auto margin. A margin set
            to auto will absorb all available space in its dimension. This is
            how centering a block with auto margins works. By setting the left
            and right margin to auto, both sides of our block try to take up all
            of the available space and so push the box into the center.
          </p>
          <p>
            By setting a margin of auto on one item in a set of flex items all
            aligned to start, we can create a split navigation. This works well
            with Flexbox and the alignment properties. As soon as there is no
            space available for the auto margin, the item behaves in the same
            way as all the other flex items and shrinks to try to fit into
            space.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/flex-alignment-4.PNG" />
          <h3>The gap properties</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>row-gap</li>
            <li>column-gap</li>
            <li>gap</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Creating fixed size gaps between items</h4>
          <p>
            On the main axis, the column-gap property creates fixed size gaps
            between adjacent items.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the cross axis the row-gap property creates spacing between
            adjacent flex lines, therefore flex-wrap must also be set to wrap
            for this to have any effect.
          </p>

          <h3>Box alignment in grid layout</h3>
          <p>
            The Box Alignment specification details how alignment works in
            various layout methods. On this page we explore how box alignment
            works in the context of CSS Grid Layout.
          </p>
          <p>
            As this page aims to detail things which are specific to CSS Grid
            Layout and Box Alignment, it should be read in conjunction with the
            main Box Alignment page which details the common features of box
            alignment across layout methods.
          </p>
          <h4>Basic example</h4>
          <p>
            In this example using grid layout, there is extra space in the grid
            container after laying out the fixed width tracks on the inline
            (main) axis. This space is distributed using justify-content. On the
            block (cross) axis the alignment of the items inside their grid
            areas is controlled with align-items. The first item overrides the
            align-items value set on the group by setting align-self to center.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/grid-alignment-2.PNG" />
          <h4>Grid axes</h4>
          <p>
            As a two-dimensional layout method, when working with grid layout we
            always have two axes on which to align our items. We have access to
            all of the box alignment properties to help us achieve this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inline axis is the axis that corresponds to the direction that
            words in a sentence would run in the writing mode used. Therefore,
            in a horizontal language such as English or Arabic the inline
            direction runs horizontally. Should you be in a vertical writing
            mode the inline axis will run vertically.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/grid-alignment-3.png" />
          <p>
            To align things on the inline axis you use the properties that start
            with justify-, justify-content, justify-items and justify-self.
          </p>
          <p>
            The block axis crosses the inline axis in the direction that blocks
            are displayed down the page — for example paragraphs in English are
            displayed one below the other vertically. This, therefore is the
            block dimension.
          </p>
          <p>
            To align things on the block axis you use the properties that start
            with align-, align-content, align-items and align-self.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/grid-alignment-4.png" />
          <h4>Self alignment</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>justify-self</li>
            <li>align-self</li>
            <li>place-self</li>
            <li>justify-items</li>
            <li>align-items</li>
            <li>place-items</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These properties deal with aligning the item inside the grid area it
            is placed into. The properties align-items and justify-items are
            applied to the grid container and set the align-self and
            justify-self properties as a group. This means that you can set
            alignment for all of your grid Items at once, then override any
            items that need a different alignment by applying the align-self or
            justify-self property to the rules for the individual grid Items.
          </p>
          <p>
            The initial value for align-self and justify-self is stretch so the
            item will stretch over the entire grid area. The exception to this
            rule is where the item has an intrinsic aspect ratio, for example an
            image. In this case the item will be aligned to start in both
            dimensions in order that the image is not distorted.
          </p>
          <h4>Content alignment</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>justify-content</li>
            <li>align-content</li>
            <li>place-content</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These properties deal with aligning the tracks of the grid when
            there is extra space to distribute. This scenario will occur if the
            tracks that you have defined total less than the total width of the
            grid container.
          </p>
          <h4>Gap and legacy grid-gap properties</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>row-gap</li>
            <li>column-gap</li>
            <li>gap</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Grid specification originally contained the definition for the
            properties grid-row-gap, grid-column-gap and grid-gap. These have
            since been moved into the Box Alignment specification and renamed to
            row-gap, column-gap, and gap. This allows them to be used for other
            layout methods where a gap between items makes sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            The updated properties have not yet been implemented in all
            browsers. Therefore, to use the gap properties in grid layout, you
            should use the grid-row-gap, grid-column-gap and grid-gap versions
            to ensure full compatibility. You could double up the properties and
            use both as you would for vendor prefixes.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Box alignment in Multi-column Layout</h3>
          <p>
            The Box Alignment Specification details how alignment works in
            various layout methods; on this page we explore how Box Alignment
            works in the context of Multi-column Layout. As this page aims to
            detail things which are specific to Multi-column Layout and Box
            Alignment, it should be read in conjunction with the main Box
            Alignment page which details the common features of Box Alignment
            across layout methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            In multi-column layout the alignment container is the content box of
            the multicol container. The alignment subject is the column box. The
            properties which apply to multi-column layouts are detailed below.
          </p>
          <h4>align-content and justify-content</h4>
          <p>
            The align-content property applies to the block axis and
            justify-content to the inline axis. Any spacing added to the columns
            due to use of space distribution will be added to the gap between
            the columns, therefore making the gap larger than might be specified
            by the column-gap property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using a value of justify-content other than normal or stretch will
            cause column boxes to display at the column-width specified on the
            multicol container, and the remaining space distributed according to
            the value of justify-content.
          </p>
          <h4>column-gap</h4>
          <p>
            The column-gap property was specified in earlier versions of the
            multiple-column layout specification, and has now been unified with
            the gap properties for other layout methods in box alignment. While
            other layout methods treat the initial value of column-gap as 0
            multicol treats it as 1em, as in general you would not want to have
            no gap between columns.
          </p>
