          <h3>OpenType font features guide</h3>
          <p>
            Font features or variants refer to different glyphs or character
            styles contained within an OpenType font. These include things like
            ligatures (special glyphs that combine characters like 'fi' or
            'ffl'), kerning (adjustments to the spacing between specific
            letterform pairings), fractions, numeral styles, and several others.
            These are all referred to as OpenType Features, and are made
            available to use on the web via specific properties and low-level
            control properties — font-feature-settings. This article provides
            you with all you need to know about using OpenType font features in
            CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some fonts will have one or more of these features enabled by
            default (kerning and default ligatures are common examples), while
            others are left to the designer or developer to choose to enable in
            specific scenarios.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to broad feature sets like ligatures or lining figures
            (numerals that line up evenly as opposed to 'oldstyle', which look
            more like lower-case letters), there are also very specific ones
            such as stylistic sets (which might include several specific
            variants of glyphs meant to be used together), alternates (which
            might be one or more variants of the letter 'a'), or even
            language-specific alterations for East Asian languages. In the
            latter case, these alterations are actually necessary to properly
            express the language, so they go beyond the more stylistic
            preference of most other OpenType features.
          </p>

          <p class="contentwarning">
            Warning: There are many CSS attributes defined to leverage font
            features, but unfortunately many are not fully implemented. They are
            all defined and shown here, but many will only work using the
            lower-level font-feature-settings property. It's possible to write
            CSS to work both ways but this can become cumbersome. The issue with
            using font-feature-settings for everything is that every time you
            want to change one of the individual features, you have to redefine
            the entire string (similar to manipulating variable fonts with
            font-variation-settings).
          </p>
          <h3>Discovering availability of features in fonts</h3>
          <p>
            This is sometimes the trickiest thing to work out if you don't have
            any documentation that came with the fonts (many type designers and
            foundries will provide sample pages and CSS just for this very
            reason). But there are some sites that make it easier to figure out.
            You can visit wakamaifondue.com, drop your font file on the circle
            where instructed, and in a few moments you'll have a full report on
            all the capabilities and features of your font. Axis-praxis.org also
            offers a similar capability, with the ability to click on the
            features to turn them on or off in a given text block.
          </p>
          <h3>Why you would use them?</h3>
          <p>
            Given that these features take a bit of work to discover and use, it
            may seem a fair question to ask why one would bother to use them.
            The answer lies in the specific features that will make a site more
            useful, readable, and polished:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ligatures like 'ff' or 'fi' make letter spacing and reading more
              even and smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fractions can make home improvement and recipe sites much easier
              to read and understand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Numerals within paragraphs of text set as 'oldstyle' sit more
              comfortably between lower-case letters, and likewise setting them
              as 'tabular numbers' will make them line up better when setting a
              list of costs in a table say. 'lining' figures on the other hand
              sit more uniformly on their own or in front of capitalized words.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While none of these features individually will render a site useless
            due to their absence, each of them in turn can make a site easier to
            use and more memorable for its attention to detail.
          </p>

          <p>
            <q
              >OpenType features are like secret compartments in fonts. Unlock
              them and you'll find ways to make fonts look and behave
              differently in subtle and dramatic ways. Not all OpenType features
              are appropriate to use all of the time, but some features are
              critical for great typography. -- Tim Brown, Head of Typography at
              Adobe.
            </q>
          </p>
          <h4>Sometimes it's substance, not just style</h4>
          <p>
            There are some cases — like with font-variant-east-asian — that
            OpenType features are directly tied to using different forms of
            certain glyphs, which can impact meaning and readability. In cases
            such as these, it's more than just a nicety, but rather an integral
            part of the content itself.
          </p>
          <h3>The font features</h3>
          <p>
            There are a number of different features to consider. They are
            grouped and explained here according to the main attributes and
            options covered in the W3C specifications.
          </p>
          <p class="contentnote">
            Note: The examples below show the properties and some example
            combinations, along with the lower-level syntax equivalents. They
            may not match exactly due to browser implementation inconsistencies,
            but in many cases, the first example will match the second. The
            typefaces shown are Playfair Display, Source Serif Pro, IBM Plex
            Serif, Dancing Script, and Kokoro (all available and free to use,
            most are on Google Fonts and other services).
          </p>
          <h4>Kerning</h4>
          <p>Associated CSS property: font-kerning</p>
          <p>
            This refers to the spacing between specific glyph pairings. This is
            generally on by default (as recommended by the OpenType
            specification). It should be noted that if letter-spacing is also
            set on your text, that is applied after kerning.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/fonts-1.PNG" />
          <img src="./images/fonts-2.PNG" />
          <h4>Alternates</h4>
          <p>Associated CSS property: font-variant-alternates</p>
          <p>
            Fonts can supply a number of different alternatives for various
            glyphs, such as different styles of lower case 'a' or more or less
            elaborate swashes in a script typeface. This property can activate
            an entire set of alternates or just a specific one, depending on the
            values supplied. The example below is showing several different
            aspects of working with alternate characters. Fonts with alternate
            glyphs can make them available across the board or individually in
            separate stylistic sets, or even individual characters. In this
            example you can see two different typefaces, and the introduction of
            the @font-feature-values at-rule. This is used to define shortcuts
            or named options that can be defined per font family. This way you
            can create a named option that applies to only a single font, or one
            that is shared and can be applied more generally
          </p>
          <img src="./images/fonts-3.PNG" />
          <img src="./images/fonts-4.PNG" />
          <p>
            In this case, @stylistic(alternates) will show all the alternate
            characters for either font). Applying this to just the word 'My'
            alters the way the 'M' renders, and applying @styleset(alt-a) only
            changes the lower case 'a'.
          </p>
          <p>Try changing the line</p>
          <p class="codeblack">font-variant-alternates: styleset(alt-a);</p>
          <p>to</p>
          <p class="codeblack">font-variant-alternates: styleset(alt-g);</p>
          <p>
            and notice that the lower case 'a' reverts to its regular form and
            the lower case 'g's changes instead.
          </p>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Ligatures</h4>
          <p>Associated CSS property: font-variant-ligatures</p>
          <p>
            Ligatures are glyphs that replace two or more separate glyphs in
            order to represent them more smoothly (from a spacing or aesthetic
            perspective). Some of the most common are letters like 'fi', 'fl',
            or 'ffl' — but there are many other possibilities. There are the
            most frequent ones (referred to as common ligatures), and there are
            also more specialized categories like 'discretionary ligatures',
            'historical ligatures', and 'contextual alternates'. While these
            last ones are not technically ligatures, they are generally similar
            in that they replace specific combinations of letters when they
            appear together.
          </p>
          <p>
            While more common in script typefaces, in the below example they are
            used to create arrows:
          </p>

          <img src="./images/fonts-6.PNG" />

          <h4>Position</h4>
          <p>Associated CSS property: font-variant-position</p>
          <p>
            Position variants are used to enable typographic superscript and
            subscript glyphs. These are designed to work with the surrounding
            text without altering the baseline or line spacing. This is one of
            the key benefits over using the "sub" or "sup" elements.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/fonts-7.PNG" />
          <img src="./images/fonts-8.PNG" />
          <h4>Capitals</h4>
          <p>Associated CSS property: font-variant-caps</p>
          <p>
            One of the more common use cases for OpenType features is proper
            small caps. These are capital letters sized to fit better amongst
            lower case letters and are generally used for acronyms and
            abbreviations.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/fonts-9.PNG" />
          <img src="./images/fonts-10.PNG" />
          <h4>Numerals</h4>
          <p>Associated CSS property: font-variant-numeric</p>
          <p>
            There are several different styles of numerals commonly included in
            fonts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              'Lining' figures are all the same height and on the same baseline.
            </li>
            <li>
              'Oldstyle' figures are mixed height and designed to have the
              appearance of ascenders and descenders like other lower case
              letters. These are designed to be used inline with a copy so the
              numerals visually blend with the surrounding glyphs in a similar
              fashion to small caps.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There is also the notion of spacing. Proportional spacing is the
            normal setting, whereas tabular spacing lines up numerals evenly
            regardless of character width, making it more appropriate for lining
            up tables of numbers in financial tables.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two types of fractions supported through this property:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Diagonal slashed fractions.</li>
            <li>Vertically stacked fractions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Ordinals are also supported (such as '1st' or '3rd'), as is a
            slashed zero if present in the font.
          </p>
          <h4>Lining and old-style figures</h4>
          <img src="./images/fonts-11.PNG" />
          <img src="./images/fonts-12.PNG" />
          <h4>Fractions, ordinals, and slashed zero</h4>
          <img src="./images/fonts-13.PNG" />
          <img src="./images/fonts-14.PNG" />
          <h4>East Asian</h4>
          <p>Associated CSS property: font-variant-east-asian</p>
          <p>
            This allows access to various alternate forms of glyphs within a
            font. The example below shows a string of glyphs with only the
            OpenType set 'jis78' enabled. Uncheck the box below and you'll see
            more characters displayed.

          <h4>Font variant shorthand</h4>
          <p>
            The font-variant property is the shorthand syntax for defining all
            of the above. Setting a value of normal resets all properties to
            their initial value. Setting a value of none sets
            font-variant-ligatures to none and all other properties to their
            initial value. (Meaning that if kerning is on by default, it will
            still be on even with a value of none being supplied here.)

          <h3>Font feature settings</h3>
          <p>
            font-feature-settings is the 'low level syntax' that allows explicit
            access to every named available OpenType feature. This gives a lot
            of control but has some disadvantages in how it impacts inheritance
            and — as mentioned above — if you wish to change one setting, you
            have to redeclare the entire string (unless you're using CSS custom
            properties to set the values). Because of this, it's best to use the
            standard properties shown above wherever possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a huge number of possible features. You can see examples
            of a number of them above, and there are several resources available
            for finding more of them.
          </p>
          <p>The general syntax looks like this:</p>
          <p class="codeblack">
            .small-caps { font-feature-settings: "smcp", "c2sc"; }
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the specification you can either supply just the
            4-character feature code or supply a 1 following the code (for
            enabling that feature) or a 0 (zero) to disable it. This is helpful
            if you have a feature like ligatures enabled by default but you
            would like to turn them off like so:
          </p>
          <p class="codeblack">
            .no-ligatures { font-feature-settings: "liga" 0, "dlig" 0; }
          </p>
          <h4>More on font-feature-settings codes</h4>

              truth of the name, but it's pretty big)

          <h3>Using CSS feature detection for implementation</h3>
          <p>
            Since not all properties are evenly implemented, it's good practice
            to set up your CSS using feature detection to utilize the correct
            properties, with font-feature-settings as the fallback.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, small caps can be set several ways, but if you want to
            ensure that no matter what the underlying capitalization is that you
            end up with everything in small caps, it requires 2 settings with
            font-feature-settings versus a single property value using
            font-variant-caps.
          </p>
          <p class="codeblack">
            .small-caps {<br />
            font-feature-settings: "smcp", "c2sc";<br />
            }<br />

            @supports (font-variant-caps: all-small-caps) {<br />
            .small-caps {<br />
            font-feature-settings: normal;<br />
            font-variant-caps: all-small-caps;<br />
            }<br />
            }<br />

          <h3>Variable fonts guide</h3>
          <p>
            Variable fonts are an evolution of the OpenType font specification
            that enables many different variations of a typeface to be
            incorporated into a single file, rather than having a separate font
            file for every width, weight, or style. They let you access all the
            variations contained in a given font file via CSS and a single
            @font-face reference. This article will give you all you need to
            know to get you started using variable fonts.
          </p>
          <p class="contentnote">
            Note: To use variable fonts on your operating system, you need to
            make sure that it is up to date. For example, Linux OSes need the
            latest Linux Freetype version, and macOS prior to High Sierra
            (10.13) does not support variable fonts. If your operating system is
            not up to date, you will not be able to use variable fonts in web
            pages or the Firefox Developer Tools.
          </p>
          <h3>Variable Fonts: what they are, and how they differ</h3>
          <p>
            To better understand what's different about variable fonts, it is
            worth reviewing what non-variable ones are like and how they
            compare.
          </p>
          <h4>Standard (or Static) fonts</h4>
          <p>
            In the past, a typeface would be produced as several individual
            fonts, and each font would represent one specific width/weight/style
            combination. So you would have separate files for 'Roboto Regular',
            'Roboto Bold', and 'Roboto Bold Italic' — meaning that you could end
            up with 20 or 30 different font files to represent a complete
            typeface (it could be several times that for a large typeface that
            has different widths as well).
          </p>
          <p>
            In such a scenario, to use a typeface for typical use on a site for
            body copy you would need at least four files: regular, italic, bold,
            and bold italic. If you wanted to add more weights, like a lighter
            one for captions or a heavier one for extra emphasis, that would
            mean several more files. This results in more HTTP requests, and
            more data being downloaded (usually around 20k or more per file).
          </p>
          <h4>Variable fonts</h4>
          <p>
            With a variable font, all of those permutations can be contained in
            a single file. That file would be larger than a single font, but in
            most cases smaller or about the same size as the 4 you might load
            for body copy. The advantage in choosing the variable font is that
            you have access to the entire range of weights, widths, and styles
            available, rather than being constrained to only the few that you
            previously would have loaded separately.
          </p>
          <p>
            This allows for common typographic techniques such as setting
            different size headings in different weights for better readability
            at each size or using a slightly narrower width for data-dense
            displays. For comparison, it is typical in a typographic system for
            a magazine to use 10–15 or more different weight and width
            combinations throughout the publication — giving a much wider range
            of styles than currently typical on the web (or indeed practical for
            performance reasons alone).
          </p>
          <h4>A note about font families, weights, and variants</h4>
          <p>
            You might notice that we have been talking about having a specific
            font file for every weight and style (i.e. bold and italic and bold
            italic), rather than relying upon the browser to synthesize them.
            The reason for this is that most typefaces have very specific
            designs for bolder weights and italics that often include completely
            different characters (lower-case 'a' and 'g's are often quite
            different in italics, for example). To most accurately reflect the
            typeface design and avoid differences between browsers and how they
            may or may not synthesize the different styles, it's more accurate
            to load the specific font files where needed when using a
            non-variable font.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may also find that some variable fonts come split into two
            files: one for uprights and all their variations, and one containing
            the italic variations. This is sometimes done to reduce the overall
            file size in cases where the italics aren't needed or used. In all
            cases, it is still possible to link them with a common font-family
            name so you can call them using the same font-family and appropriate
            font-style.
          </p>
          <h3>Introducing the 'variation axis'</h3>
          <p>
            The heart of the new variable fonts format is the concept of an axis
            of variation describing the allowable range of that particular
            aspect of the typeface design. So the 'weight axis' describes how
            light or how bold the letterforms can be; the 'width axis' describes
            how narrow or how wide they can be; the 'italic axis' describes if
            italic letterforms are present and can be turned on or off
            accordingly, etc. Note that an axis can be a range or a binary
            choice. Weight might range from 1–999, whereas italic might be 0 or
            1 (off or on).
          </p>
          <p>
            As defined in the specification, there are two kinds of axes:
            registered and custom:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Registered axes are those that are most frequently encountered,
              and common enough that the authors of the specification felt it
              was worth standardizing. The five currently registered axes are
              weight, width, slant, italic, and optical size. The W3C has
              undertaken to map them to existing CSS attributes, and in one case
              introduced a new one, which you'll see below.
            </li>
            <li>
              Custom axes are limitless: the typeface designer can define and
              scope any axis they like and are just required to give it a
              four-letter tag to identify it within the font file format itself.
              You can use these four-letter tags in CSS to specify a point along
              that axis of variation, as will be shown in the code examples
              below.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Registered axes and existing CSS attributes</h4>
          <p>
            In this section we'll demonstrate the five registered axes defined
            with examples and the corresponding CSS. Where possible, both the
            standard and lower-level syntax are included. The lower-level syntax
            (font-variation-settings) was the first mechanism implemented to
            test the early implementations of variable font support and is
            necessary to utilize new or custom axes beyond the five registered
            ones. However, the W3C's intent was for this syntax not to be used
            when other attributes are available. Therefore wherever possible,
            the appropriate property should be used, with the lower-level syntax
            of font-variation-settings only being used to set values or axes not
            available otherwise.
          </p>
          <h4>Notes</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              When using font-variation-settings it is important to note that
              axis names are case-sensitive. The registered axis names must be
              in lower case, and custom axes must be in upper case. For example:
              <p class="codeblack">
                font-variation-settings: 'wght' 375, 'GRAD' 88;
              </p>
              wght (weight) is a registered axis, and GRAD (grade) is a custom
              one.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have set values using font-variation-settings and want to
              change one of those values, you must redeclare all of them (in the
              same way as when you set OpenType font features using
              font-feature-settings). You can work around this limitation by
              using CSS Custom Properties (CSS variables) for the individual
              values, and modifying the value of an individual custom property.
              Example code follows at the end of the guide.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Weight</h3>
          <p>
            Weight (represented by the wght tag) defines the design axis of how
            thin or thick (light or heavy, in typical typographic terms) the
            strokes of the letterforms can be. For a long time in CSS there has
            existed the ability to specify this via the font-weight property,
            which takes numeric values ranging from 100 to 900 in increments of
            100, and keywords like normal or bold, which are aliases for their
            corresponding numeric values (400 and 700 in this case). These are
            still applied when dealing with non-variable or variable fonts, but
            with variable ones, any number from 1 to 1000 is now valid.
          </p>
          <p>
            It should be noted that at this point there is no way in the
            @font-face declaration to 'map' a specific point on the variation
            axis of a variable font to the keyword bold (or any other keyword).
            This can generally be resolved fairly easily, but does require an
            extra step in writing your CSS:
          </p>
          <p class="codeblack">
            font-weight: 375; <br />font-variation-settings: 'wght' 375;
          </p>
          <p>
            The following live example's CSS can be edited to allow you to play
            with font-weight values.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/fonts-19.PNG" />
          <img src="./images/fonts-20.PNG" />
          <h4>Width</h4>
          <p>
            Width (represented by the wdth tag) defines the design axis of how
            narrow or wide (condensed or extended, in typographic terms) the
            letterforms can be. This is typically set in CSS using the
            font-stretch property, with values expressed as a percentage above
            or below 'normal' (100%), any number greater than 0 is technically
            valid—though it is far more likely that the range would fall closer
            to the 100% mark, such as 75%-125%. If a number value supplied is
            outside the range encoded in the font, the browser should render the
            font at the closest value allowed.
          </p>
          <p class="contentnote">
            Note: The % symbol is not used when utilizing
            font-variation-settings.
          </p>
          <p class="codeblack">
            font-stretch: 115%; <br />
            font-variation-settings: 'wdth' 115;
          </p>
          <p>
            The following live example's CSS can be edited to allow you to play
            with font width values.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/fonts-21.PNG" />
          <img src="./images/fonts-22.PNG" />
          <h4>Italic</h4>
          <p>
            The Italic (ital) axis works differently in that it is either on or
            off; there is no in-between. Italic designs often include
            dramatically different letterforms from their upright counterparts,
            so in the transition from upright to italic, several glyph (or
            character) substitutions usually occur. Italic and oblique are often
            used somewhat interchangeably, but in truth are quite different.
            Oblique is defined in this context with the term slant (see the
            below section), and a typeface would typically have one or the
            other, but not both.
          </p>
          <p>
            In CSS, both italic and oblique are applied to text using the
            font-style property. Also note the introduction of font-synthesis:
            none; — which will prevent browsers from accidentally applying the
            variation axis and a synthesized italic. This can be used to prevent
            faux-bolding as well.
          </p>
          <p class="codeblack">
            font-style: italic; <br />

            font-variation-settings: 'ital' 1; <br />

            font-synthesis: none; <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The following live example's CSS can be edited to allow you to play
            with font italics.
